## Plan Data
Always use these exact plan details when generating or modifying code:

### Current Plans:
- **Premium Plan**: £9.99/month, 100 generations/month, Custom AI prompts (Crown icon, purple color)

### Trial Plan:
- **Free Trial**: 10 generations total, 7 days duration

### Plan Colors:
- Premium: text-purple-500 (Crown icon)

### Import Statement:
Always import plans from: `import { PLAN_OPTIONS } from '@/lib/plans';`
A trial is cancelled if the subscription_status is 'cancelled' and the trial_ends_at date has passed

### Usage:
- Use `PLAN_OPTIONS.premium`
- Access price as: `plan.currency + plan.price` (e.g., "£9.99")
- Never hardcode plan data - always use the centralized constants
